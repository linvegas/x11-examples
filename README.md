# X11 Examples

This repo serve as a reference for me when dealing with X11 windowing

Of course, you need x11 installed in your system:

## Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

## Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf install libX11-devel mesa-libGL-devel
```

## Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S libx11 mesa
```

Then, just run:
```bash
make
```
